This repository conatains all of my work for the Machine Learning assignment. For the assignment i did option 1-4 and the essay.

Option 1 - Linear Regression:
Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables as a linear equation to predict the dependent variable's values.

Option 2 - K-NN:
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that makes predictions for new data points by identifying the most similar training examples (neighbors) based on a specified number (K) and using their labels to determine the prediction.

Option 3 - K Means
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups data points into K clusters based on their similarity, with each cluster represented by its center (centroid).

Essay:
My essay is responding to the third prompt "Privacy in the Age of AI: Navigating the Ethical Dimensions of Machine
Learning"
